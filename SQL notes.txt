Data types:
INT - number (from -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647) 4 bites
INT(5) - will only show the first 5 numbers of a number
INT(11) - the default

BIGINT - a big number 8 bites

FLOAT - 4 bites
DOUBLE - basically a big float.

VARCHAR(10) - string of 10 characters.
VARCHAR(255) - the typical maximum

TEXT

DATE 2023-12-21 - can be formatted differently
DATETIME 2023-12-21 20:55:10



Signed and unsigned:
INT(11) SIGNED - both positive and negative numbers
INT(11) UNSIGNED - only the positive numbers (from 0 to 4 294 967 295)



NOT NULL - the value HAS to be assigned, it's not allowed to be empty.
AUTO_INCREMENT - it'll automatically increment each new row. It's always unsigned
pwd - 'password'

DEFAULT - the default value that'll be used if there's no data
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME - will automatically use time of creation. Or we could also pass in the datetime from PHP

There are two ways to set the primary key:
id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY,
 or
PRIMARY KEY (id)

Primary key has to be unique. It can't have duplicates.


This:
users_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (users_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
is how we connect two tables together. users_id in this table is equal to so id from the users table. If the user is deleted from the users table - we throw an error do not allow it to happen.

FOREIGN KEY (users_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
if the user is deleted from the users table - we cascade it and delete all of this user's comments.

FOREIGN KEY (users_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE SET NULL
if the user is deleted from the users table - we'll set users_id to NULL
